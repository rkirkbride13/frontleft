# frontleft

## Intro

With sometimes endless music festival lineups it can be a bit daunting choosing what stages to be at and when, knowing that you may be missing some of your favourite acts or running back and forth and not actually seeing any! This is where frontleft comes in. 

Frontleft will help you plan out your days at a festival and catch every moment of your favourite artists.

Since finishing the Makers Academy coding bootcamp I have setout to learn TypeScript and have created this app using it.

## Technologies

This is a MERN stack application but instead of writing in JavaScript I have used TypeScript. The styling has been done using CSS. 

The backend was test driven using Jest, as well as testing calls using Postman. The frontend was tested via user interaction, with the intention to add tests as I develop it.
